* Show the code you would use for a database migration that added a field “permalink” to
an existing table called “post”. The migration is to also create a permalink for every
existing Post record based on the “title” field. You can use any method you want to
convert title to become permalink, the only requirements being permalink must be based
on title, must be constructed of only URL valid characters, and must be unique (even if
another Post has the same title and converts to the same permalink).

* Credit cards use a check digit algorithm called the Luhn algorithm. Write a function that
takes one parameter, the credit card number, and returns true or false depending on
whether the number is a valid number.Similarly, write a second function that takes a
number of any length and calculates the Luhn check digit and returns the original
number with the check digit appended on the end.
